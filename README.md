# Single cell quantification
Module for single-cell data extraction given a segmentation mask and multi-channel image. The CSV structure is aligned with histoCAT output.

**CommandSingleCellExtraction.py**:

* `--masks` Paths to where masks are stored (Ex: ./segmentation/cellMask.tif) -> If multiple masks are selected the first mask will be used for spatial feature extraction but all will be quantified

* `--image` Path to image(s) for quantification.  (Ex: ./registration/*.h5) -> works with .h(df)5 or .tif(f)

* `--output` Path to output directory. (Ex: ./feature_extraction)

* `--channel_names` csv file containing the channel names for the z-stack (Ex: ./my_channels.csv)

* `--intensity_props` Additional properties to be quantified.
    See list at https://scikit-image.org/docs/dev/api/skimage.measure.html#regionprops
    Additionally available is gini_index.

# Run script
`python CommandSingleCellExtraction.py --masks ./segmentation/cellMask.tif ./segmentation/membraneMask.tif --image ./registration/Exemplar_001.h5  --output ./feature_extraction --channel_names ./my_channels.csv`
